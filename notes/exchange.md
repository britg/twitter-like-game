# The Tavernlight Exchange
A loot economy MMO

### Benefits of this approach

- Real simulation
- Stuff happens while you're away

### Gameplay Concept

- You manage a party of adventurers: gear, buffs, items
  - shared inventory between all of them
- They are constantly "crawling" the dungeon or area you have them assigned to
- They generate loot in a stream of events
- You use this loot to upgrade your adventurers
- Or sell the loot on the exchange.
- Go to the exchange to get potions, equipment, etc.
- Also go to the exchange for necessary "quest" items - keys, etc. that are being sold by other players
