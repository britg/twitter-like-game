_You get the sense that Otto wasn't listening..._

"Ah, I was a young and stupid like you once..."

_The other patrons at the bar moan and turn away_

Tavernkeep

"I remember once we were in Altos; you were just a twinkle in your mum's eye ..."

_Otto stops abruptly, his eye glancing behind you, and makes himself busy wiping down the counter. Although sudden, and suspicious, you're grateful._

Refenes

"Hey, trouser stain. You're on my stool."

_You turn around to see the largest man you've ever seen._

Stranger

"The name's ___"

Refenes

"What? I don't care what your name is. I said, you're on my stool. The way I figure, that means you're on my land. And now you gotta pay me for use of my land."

_Two rat-faced lackeys behind him snicker_

Stranger
