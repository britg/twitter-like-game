**Otto, the Tavernkeep**

"Welcome stranger. What'll you have?"

**Otto, the Tavernkeep**

**Otto, the Tavernkeep**

_Otto grins_

"I was a young and stupid like you once..."

_The other patrons at the bar moan and turn away_

**Otto, the Tavernkeep**

"Lost my leg" ... _Otto raps his wooden leg with his knuckles_ ... "oh 10 years back now out in [Diver's Den]. Nastiest quillboar you ever seen..."

Refenes

"You're on my stool."

_Two rat-faced lackeys behind him snicker_
